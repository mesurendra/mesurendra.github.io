I am Surendra Sedhai, data scientist at Tabcorp, Sydney. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University(NTU), Singapore and supervised by <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/axsun/">Aixin Sun.</a>

I am passionate about social data science, spam detection in social networks and NLP. I am also interested in large-scale machine learning algorithms, recommender systems and neural architectures for deep learning.
